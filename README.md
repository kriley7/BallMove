# BallMove
Edit the python program to implement the following ball move features:
- currently, you may use the arrow to send the ball off the screen. Edit the program
  so that the ball does not move past or over any of the edges. The full ball must be
  visible at all times (will require some calculation involving ball-width-height 
  and the display window dimensions).
- add a check for a key press of the number 0. When 0 is pressed, the ball should move to
  the center of the display window. Calculate this to mean that the center of the ball
  should be in the center (will also require some calculation involving ball-width-height 
  and the display window dimensions).
- add a check for a key press of the space bar. When the space bar is pressed, the ball
  should jump and then return back to the height where it started. The formula for a jump 
  is h = 1/8 * g *  t^2
