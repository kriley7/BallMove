# BallMove
Edit the PyGameKeyMove program to implement the following ball move features:
- currently, the program allows you to move the ball off the screen. Edit the program
  so that the ball does not move past or over any of the edges. The full ball must be
  visible at all times (will require some calculation involving your program constants).
- add a check for a key press of the 0 key. When 0 is pressed, the ball should move to
  the center of the display window. Calculate this to mean that the center of the ball
  should be in the center (will also require some calculations involving the constants).
  The list of names for keys used by PyGame may be found at https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html
- Add a similar check for the keypad 0. This is a different key name - see the documentation 
  above.
- Add checks for the "Home" and the "End" keys. The "Home" key should send the ball to the
  upper left corner, and the "End" key should send it to the lower right corner.
- Feel free to add some other features as desired! We talked in class a bit about modifying the
  ball to jump up and down when you press the space bar. This is more complicated. If you do
  add some features, be sure to describe them in the documentation for your code.
- When you are finished please be sure to commit and push your code!
